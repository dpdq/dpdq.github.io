	<p>Abstract: We give a pedagogical presentation of the irreducible unitary representations of C4⋊Spin(4,C), that is, of the universal cover of the complexified Poincaré group C4⋊SO(4,C). These representations were first investigated by Roffman in 1967. We provide a modern formulation of his results together with some facts from the general Wigner-Mackey theory which are relevant in this context. Moreover, we discuss different ways to realize these representations and, in the case of a non-zero "complex mass", we give a detailed construction of a more explicit realization. This explicit realization parallels and extends the one used in the classical Wigner case of R4⋊Spin0(1,3). Our analysis is motivated by the interest in the Euclidean formulation of Fermionic theories. </p></li>

	<p>Abstract: In this article we are concerned with finite dimensional Fermions, by which we mean vectors in a finite dimensional complex space embedded in the exterior algebra over itself. These Fermions are spinless but possess the characterizing anticommutativity property. We associate invariant complex vector fields on the Lie group Spin(2n+1) to the Fermionic creation and annihilation operators. These vector fields are elements of the complexification of the regular representation of the Lie algebra so(2n+1). As such, they do not satisfy the canonical anticommutation relations, however, once they have been projected onto an appropriate subspace of L2(Spin(2n+1)), these relations are satisfied. We define a free time evolution of this system of Fermions in terms of a symmetric positive-definite quadratic form in the creation-annihilation operators. The realization of Fermionic creation and annihilation operators brought by the (invariant) vector fields allows us to interpret this time evolution in terms of a positive selfadjoint operator which is the sum of a second order operator, which generates a stochastic diffusion process, and a first order complex operator, which strongly commutes with the second order operator. A probabilistic interpretation is given in terms of a Feynman-Kac like formula with respect to the diffusion process associated with the second order operator.</p></li>

	<p>Abstract: We introduce a stochastic analysis of Grassmann random variables suitable for the stochastic quantization of Euclidean fermionic quantum field theories. Analysis on Grassmann algebras is developed here from the point of view of quantum probability: a Grassmann random variable is an homomorphism of an abstract Grassmann algebra into a quantum probability space, i.e. a C∗-algebra endowed with a suitable state. We define the notion of Gaussian processes, Brownian motion and stochastic (partial) differential equations taking values in Grassmann algebras. We use them to study the long time behavior of finite and infinite dimensional Langevin Grassmann stochastic differential equations driven by Gaussian space-time white noise and to describe their invariant measures. As an application we give a proof of the stochastic quantization and of the removal of the space cut-off for the Euclidean Yukawa model. </p></li>
